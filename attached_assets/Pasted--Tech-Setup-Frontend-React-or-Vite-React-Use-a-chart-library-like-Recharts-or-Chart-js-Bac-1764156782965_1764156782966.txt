. Tech & Setup
Frontend: React (or Vite + React).
Use a chart library like Recharts or Chart.js.
Backend: Node.js + Express with simple mock APIs that simulate live data updates (in-memory or random generator).
2. Metrics & Graphs (All Colorful)
Create a “Performance Dashboard” page with at least these charts:
Overall Performance Trend (Line Chart)
X-axis: Time (days/weeks/months).
Y-axis: Performance Score (0–100) or KPI index.
Multiple lines with different colors, e.g.:
Line 1: Sales Performance
Line 2: Operations Performance
Line 3: HR/People Performance
Use bright, distinct colors for each line.
Show tooltips and legend.
Department-wise KPI (Bar or Column Chart)
X-axis: Departments (Sales, Ops, HR, Finance, IT, etc.).
Y-axis: KPI value (e.g., target achievement %, productivity score).
Each bar with a different color.
Hover tooltip shows department name + value.
Employee Performance Distribution (Donut / Pie Chart)
Segments:
Top Performers
Meets Expectations
Needs Improvement
Use 3–5 contrasting colors.
Legend + percentage labels.
Live Organizational Metric (Real-time Widget)
Small live-updating tile or mini-chart showing, for example:
“Live Active Employees Online”
“Live Tickets/Tasks Open”
Auto-refresh / animate every 5–10 seconds.
3. Live / Real-time Behavior
Create a backend endpoint, e.g.:
GET /api/performance/trends
GET /api/performance/departments
GET /api/performance/distribution
GET /api/performance/live-metric
Simulate live data by:
Slightly changing values on each request, or
Using setInterval on the server to update an in-memory dataset.
On the frontend:
Use setInterval or setTimeout to call APIs every 10–15 seconds.
Smoothly update chart data (no full page reload).
Show a small “Last updated: HH:MM:SS” label.
4. UI / UX Requirements
Place all charts in a single dashboard layout:
Top: Big line chart (Overall Performance Trend).
Left bottom: Department bar chart.
Right bottom: Pie/Donut chart.
Top-right or header area: Live Metric tile(s).
Charts must be:
Colorful (no dull grey-only charts).
Responsive (work on laptop screen and tablet).
Add filters:
Time range selector: [Last 7 days] [Last 30 days] [Last Quarter]
Metric filter dropdown: choose which KPI to show (e.g. Revenue, Productivity, Attendance).
5. Interactivity & Details
Enable:
Hover tooltips with detailed values.
Legend to toggle series visibility (e.g., hide Ops line on click).
Optional:
On clicking a bar (department), show a small detail panel underneath with:
Department KPI breakdown.
Trend mini-sparkline.
6. Code Quality
Components:
PerformanceDashboard
OverallTrendChart
DepartmentKpiChart
PerformanceDistributionChart
LiveMetricCard
Clean state management (React hooks).
No broken buttons or dummy charts:
Every chart must display real data fetched from backend endpoints.
Add a short README:
How to run (commands).
Which metrics are simulated.
How often data refreshes.
