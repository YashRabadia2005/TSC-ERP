1. Tech Stack (Replit Project)
Create a full-stack Node.js + Express + React app (or Vite + React frontend with Node/Express backend in the same Replit).
Use simple in-memory data or a JSON file for storage (no need for a real DB, but keep the code structured so DB can be added later).
2. Features Needed
A. Authentication – Login & Logout
Login page:
Fields:
Employee ID or Email
Password
On successful login:
Store auth info (simple JWT or session token) in browser storage.
Redirect to Employee Dashboard.
On failed login:
Show clear error message.
Logout:
“Logout” button in the dashboard.
Clears auth token/session.
Redirect to Login page.
Create a simple dummy user list in backend for login (e.g., 2–3 test employees).
B. Attendance Actions (Daily)
On the dashboard, add buttons and make them WORK with backend APIs:
Check-In
Check-Out
Break Start
Break End
Each click must:
Automatically capture:
Employee ID (from logged-in user)
Current date
Timestamp
Action type (checkin/checkout/break_start/break_end)
Save entry through backend API.
Rules:
Employee can Check-In only once per day.
After Check-In:
Disable Check-In button.
While on break:
Disable Break Start, enable Break End.
After Check-Out:
Disable all action buttons for that day.
C. Time Calculations
For each day per employee, automatically calculate:
Total Working Hours = time between Check-In and Check-Out.
Total Break Time = sum of all (Break End − Break Start).
Net Work Hours = Total Working Hours − Total Break Time.
Show these values in the daily record.
3. Backend API Design (Express)
Create working REST endpoints like:
POST /api/login
Validates employee and returns token/basic session info.
POST /api/attendance/checkin
POST /api/attendance/checkout
POST /api/attendance/break-start
POST /api/attendance/break-end
GET /api/attendance/today?employeeId=...
Returns today’s attendance details (times + calculated hours).
GET /api/attendance/history?employeeId=...&from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD
Returns list of days with:
Date
Check-In
Check-Out
Total Working Hours
Break Time
Net Hours
Status (Present / Absent / Half Day – you can derive based on hours)
Keep the data in a simple in-memory structure or JSON file, e.g.:
// Example attendance structure[
  {
    employeeId: "EMP001",
    date: "2025-11-26",
    checkinTime: "09:02",
    checkoutTime: "18:10",
    breaks: [
      { startTime: "13:00", endTime: "13:30" }
    ],
    totalWorkingHours: "09:08",
    breakHours: "00:30",
    netHours: "08:38",
    status: "Present"  }
]
4. Frontend (React)
Pages/Components:
LoginPage
Form (Employee ID/Email, Password).
On submit → call /api/login.
Save token & basic employee info.
Redirect to /dashboard.
Dashboard
Show greeting with employee name.
Show today’s attendance summary:
Today’s date.
Check-In time (if done).
Check-Out time (if done).
Total Working Hours.
Break Time.
Net Hours.
Buttons:
[Check-In]
[Break Start]
[Break End]
[Check-Out]
Enable/disable buttons based on today’s state (use API data).
Include a small section “Recent 5 days attendance” in a table.
AttendanceHistory
Table with:
Date
Check-In
Check-Out
Net Hours
Status
Filters:
From Date
To Date
Button: “Load History” → calls /api/attendance/history.
5. Validation & UX
Show clear messages (toast/alert) for:
“Successfully checked in”
“Break started”
“Break ended”
“Successfully checked out”
“You have already checked in today”
“You must check in before starting a break”
Handle edge cases:
No multiple check-ins.
No check-out before check-in.
6. Quality & Structure
The project must run inside Replit with:
npm install
npm run dev or similar (document in README).
Separate frontend and backend logic clearly.
No dummy/non-functional buttons – everything must call a real endpoint and update state.
Add a short README in the Replit project explaining:
How to run.
Test credentials.
Flow of attendance (check-in → break → check-out).
Goal:
Deliver a fully working HRMS login + daily attendance module (login, logout, check-in, check-out, break start/end, daily calculations, and basic history), ready to demo to employees.
