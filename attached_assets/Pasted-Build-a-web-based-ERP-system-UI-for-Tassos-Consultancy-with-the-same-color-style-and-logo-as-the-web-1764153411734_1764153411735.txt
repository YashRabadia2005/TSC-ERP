Build a web-based ERP system UI for Tassos Consultancy with the same color style and logo as the website https://tassosconsultancy.com
1. Branding & Theme
Use a clean, modern UI inspired by https://tassosconsultancy.com
Color palette (approximate from the site – use as theme variables):
--primary-blue: #0097D7;  (main accent color)
--dark-grey: #4B4B4D;
--mid-grey: #6F6F72;
--light-grey-bg: #F5F5F7;
--white: #FFFFFF;
Typography: use a modern sans-serif font similar to the site (e.g., Poppins or Roboto).
Overall look: a lot of white space, blue accents for buttons and highlights, grey for text and section titles.
2. Logo Integration
Use the same logo as the website:
https://tassosconsultancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TCS-PNG-LOGOwTXT-color.webp
Place the logo in:
Top-left of the main app header.
Login screen.
Optionally in a small form in the footer.
Ensure the logo scales nicely and looks sharp on desktop and tablet.
3. Layout & Navigation
Create a responsive layout (works on desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Main structure:
Top navigation bar: Logo (left), user profile & logout button (right).
Left sidebar menu with the following ERP sections:
Dashboard
Attendance & Time Tracking
HR & Payroll
Inventory & Assets
Finance & Accounting
CRM / Clients
Reports & Analytics
Settings
Highlight the current section using the primary blue color.
4. Core Functionality & Buttons (All Working)
Implement fully working buttons and forms (no dead links). At minimum:
a) Dashboard
Show live cards/tiles for key metrics with auto-refresh/live tracking:
Total active employees
Today’s present / absent count
Open tasks / tickets
Pending approvals
Add at least one live-updating chart (e.g., attendance trend, sales, or tasks) using dummy data that updates every 5–10 seconds (simulate real-time data).
b) Attendance & Time Tracking
Page with:
Date filters (From / To)
Employee search bar
Table showing:
Employee Name
Date
Check-in time
Check-out time
Total hours
Status (Present / Absent / On Leave)
Buttons that must work:
Add Manual Entry
Export to CSV
Filter / Apply
Implement full client-side validation and working table interactions (sorting, searching).
c) HR & Payroll
Simple employee list with:
Name, ID, Department, Designation, Status
Buttons:
Add Employee
Edit (opens a form with existing data)
Deactivate / Activate
Data should be stored in a local database or JSON (or mock DB) so that changes reflect in the UI while the app is running.
d) Inventory & Assets
CRUD interface for assets:
Asset Name, Category, Location, Assigned To, Status
Buttons:
Add Asset, Edit, Delete, Search/Filter
All actions must update the list on screen.
e) Finance & Accounting (basic)
Table of transactions with:
Date, Voucher No, Type (Income/Expense), Amount, Department
Filters by date and type.
Show small summary widgets: Total Income, Total Expense, Net.
f) CRM / Clients
Client master list with:
Name, Organization, Contact, Email, Status
Buttons:
Add Client
View Details
Edit
Include a search bar that actually filters the list.
5. Live Tracking of Data
Implement live/real-time UI updates using one of:
WebSocket (preferred, even if simulated), or
Polling every X seconds to refresh dummy data.
Examples of live updates:
Dashboard charts and tiles auto-refresh.
“Online employees” or “Active sessions” counters update in real time.
Make sure the UI shows loading states while data is being fetched/updated.
6. Quality & Testing
All buttons, links, and forms must be fully functional:
No dead buttons.
Form validation (required fields, wrong formats, etc.).
Clear success and error messages (toasts or alerts).
Provide basic unit tests or simple end-to-end tests (if possible) for:
Navigation between modules.
Adding/editing records in at least one module.
Handle error states gracefully (e.g., show error banners if data load fails).
7. Tech Stack (you choose, but must be modern)
Frontend: React (preferred) or any modern JS framework.
Styling: TailwindCSS or CSS modules with variables for the color palette.
Backend: Simple Node/Express or any in-memory/mock backend for demo, with clear APIs for:
/api/dashboard
/api/attendance
/api/employees
/api/assets
/api/transactions
/api/clients
Structure the project cleanly so it can be extended later.
8. Final Deliverable
A fully running ERP web app with:
Tassos logo integrated.
Color theme similar to https://tassosconsultancy.com
All modules and buttons working.
Live data tracking (simulated) on the dashboard.
Provide:
Instructions to run the project.
Short README explaining modules and how live data is simulated.
