Daily Wage=Gross SalaryMonthly Working Days\text{Daily Wage} = \frac{\text{Gross Salary}}{\text{Monthly Working Days}}Daily Wage=Monthly Working DaysGross Salary
✔ Hourly Wage
Hourly Wage=Daily WageWorking Hours Per Day\text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{\text{Daily Wage}}{\text{Working Hours Per Day}}Hourly Wage=Working Hours Per DayDaily Wage
Example:
Gross Salary = ₹50,000
Working Days = 26
Working Hours per day = 9
Daily Wage=5000026=₹1923.08\text{Daily Wage} = \frac{50000}{26} = ₹1923.08Daily Wage=2650000=₹1923.08Hourly Wage=1923.089=₹213.67\text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{1923.08}{9} = ₹213.67Hourly Wage=91923.08=₹213.67
⚙️ 3️⃣ Overtime Rate Formula
Different companies apply:
Type of OT	Policy	Formula
Normal OT (Weekdays)	1.5x pay	OT Rate = Hourly Wage × 1.5
Weekly Off / Public Holiday OT	2x pay	OT Rate = Hourly Wage × 2
🧮 4️⃣ Actual OT Payment Formula
OT Amount=OT Hours×Hourly Wage×OT Rate Factor\text{OT Amount} = \text{OT Hours} \times \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{OT Rate Factor}OT Amount=OT Hours×Hourly Wage×OT Rate Factor
Example:
OT Hours: 10 hours
Rate Factor: 1.5 (Weekday)
10×213.67×1.5=₹3,205.0510 \times 213.67 \times 1.5 = ₹3,205.0510×213.67×1.5=₹3,205.05
